What is the routing?
    Routing in Angular refers to the process of navigating between different views or pages within an application.
    Angular provides a powerful routing mechanism that allows you to define routes, associate them with components, and handle navigation between these routes.

setup Router:
    1. import RouterModule
    2. configure forRoot once this method allow us to add multiple route config.
