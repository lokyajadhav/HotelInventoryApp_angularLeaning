What are dependencies?
    dependencies are the service or object needed by the class to perform some functions.

dependency injection?
    provinding/injecting required depe to the clss is called dependency injection.
    angular has built-in dependency injection support.

services:
        services are the place where the business logic is written, and it will be used where ever the logic is required.
        CREATING SERVICE:
            -->ng g s service_name;
        then we will write all the business login inside the particular service and we will inject when we required.
            --injecting dependency--
                in class, we use constructor to inject dependencies.
                ex:
                constructor(service:service_Class_Name)
                {

                }
            Note: genarally all the service creates single instance, but if we reqires seperate instance for any particular component we can add below code in @Component:
                'Providers:[service_Class_Name]'
